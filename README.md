# Transformers_Computer-Vision

A repository for computer vision experiments and projects using Transformers. This project includes notebooks, scripts, and datasets for image processing and deep learning tasks.

## Project Structure
```bash
Transformers_Computer-Vision/
├── Hasaan_Maqsood_ps2.ipynb        # Jupyter Notebook  
├── Hasaan_Maqsood_ps2-Copy1.ipynb  
├── SegMed/                          # Subproject or dataset folder  
├── fix_kernel.py                     # Utility script  
├── requirements.txt                  # Python dependencies  
```
> Note: The `env/` folder is not included in the repository to reduce size. Use `requirements.txt` to recreate the environment.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the environment and run the project:

1. **Clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hasaanmaqsood/Transformers-in-Computer-Vision
cd Transformers_Computer-Vision
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**

Linux / macOS:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
```
4.  **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

- The requirements.txt file contains all necessary Python packages with exact versions.
- The repository is compatible with Python 3.10 (as used in the original environment).
